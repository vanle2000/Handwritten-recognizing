# Overview 
In the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning, one of the most fascinating and impactful applications is the recognition of handwritten digits. From postal services to digitizing historical documents, the ability to automatically interpret and classify handwritten characters has transformed various industries. One of the fundamental algorithms used for such tasks is the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. In this project, we embark on a journey to develop a Handwritten Digit Recognition System using the KNN algorithm, building it from the ground up.

Handwritten digit recognition involves the extraction of meaningful features from raw pixel data and the subsequent classification of those digits into their respective numerical labels. The KNN algorithm, while relatively simple in concept, holds remarkable versatility and performance across a spectrum of classification tasks. Unlike parametric models, KNN is a non-parametric instance-based learning algorithm that does not assume any underlying distribution of the data. Instead, it relies on the proximity of data points in the feature space to make predictions. This attribute makes KNN particularly suitable for tackling problems where the decision boundary is complex and not easily expressible by a simple mathematical equation.


# DataSet
The MNIST dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a collection of grayscale images, each representing a handwritten digit (0-9). With a total of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, MNIST serves as a foundational dataset for developing and evaluating algorithms related to image classification and pattern recognition.


# Models
I came up with 2 types of models 
1. simple k-NN model
2. weighted k-NN model
